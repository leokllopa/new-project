      <h1>What is Dividend Discount Model (DDM)?</h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>Dividend Discount Model (DDM)</strong> is a valuation method
        that determines a company's intrinsic value based on the present value
        of its future dividends. It’s commonly used for valuing dividend-paying
        stocks.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Do We Use DDM?</h3>
      <p>
        DDM helps investors answer a key question: “Is this dividend-paying
        stock worth investing in?” It allows you to evaluate whether the stock
        price reflects its fair value based on the dividends it pays. This way,
        you can decide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Is the stock underpriced?</strong> If yes, it might be a good
          investment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Is the stock overpriced?</strong> If yes, it may not provide
          good returns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Does DDM Work?</h3>
      <p>
        The model assumes the value of a stock is the sum of all its future
        dividends, discounted back to their present value. It works well for
        companies that pay consistent and predictable dividends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DDM Formula:</strong>
        <br />
        Stock Value = Expected Dividend ÷ (Discount Rate - Dividend Growth Rate)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For Example:</strong> Imagine a company is expected to pay a
        dividend of $2 per share next year, with a dividend growth rate of 5%
        and a discount rate of 10%.
        <br />
        Stock Value = $2 ÷ (0.10 - 0.05) = $40
      </p>
      <p>This means the stock is worth $40 based on its future dividends.</p>

      <h3>Why is DDM Important?</h3>
      <p>
        The DDM is especially valuable for investors who prioritize dividends.
        It provides insights into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Dividend Sustainability:</strong> Is the company likely to
          maintain or grow its dividends?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fair Value of Dividend Stocks:</strong> Helps determine if the
          stock price is justified based on dividend payouts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When Should You Use DDM?</h3>
      <p>
        The DDM is most effective for companies with stable and predictable
        dividends, like established utility or consumer goods companies.
        However, it’s less suitable for companies that don’t pay dividends or
        have inconsistent payout policies.
      </p>

      <h3>DDM Example: Steady Dividend Stock</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine a utility company pays a dividend of $3 per share, and you
        expect its dividends to grow by 4% annually. You set a discount rate of
        8% to account for risk and opportunity cost.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Expected Dividend Next Year = $3 × (1 + 0.04) = $3.12</li>
        <li>Stock Value = $3.12 ÷ (0.08 - 0.04) = $78</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Based on the DDM calculation, the intrinsic value of the stock is $78.
        If the market price is below this, it might be a good buy.
      </p>

      <h3>Final Thought</h3>
      <p>
        While the DDM is a powerful tool for valuing dividend-paying stocks,
        it’s not without limitations. The model relies on assumptions about
        dividend growth and discount rates, which may not always hold true. For
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Dividends Can Be Unpredictable:</strong> Economic downturns or
          company-specific issues can lead to dividend cuts or suspensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Growth Rates Are Assumptions:</strong> A miscalculation in
          growth rates can lead to over- or undervaluation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use DDM as a guide but always consider the broader financial health of
        the company and market conditions.
