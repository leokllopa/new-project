      <h2>Risk and Return</h2>
      <p>
        Risk and return are closely connected in investing: to achieve higher
        returns, you often need to take on higher risks, while lower risks
        usually result in lower returns.
      </p>
      <h3>Risk Aversion</h3>
      <p>
        People naturally dislike risk because losing something they already have
        feels uncomfortable, even if the loss is small. This is why many prefer
        safer options like savings accounts, even though the returns are
        minimal.
      </p>

      <h3>Psychology in Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Emotions and cognitive biases significantly influence how investors
        perceive and respond to risk. Key psychological factors include:
        <strong> Fear of Loss (or Fear of Missing Out)</strong>, which drives
        decisions based on avoiding losses or chasing trends;
        <strong> Overconfidence</strong>, leading to risky or poorly-informed
        investments; and
        <strong> Cognitive Biases</strong>, such as herd mentality and
        anchoring, that shape investment behaviors in ways that may defy logic
        or rationality.
      </p>
      <h3>Risk Aversion and The Role of Human Psychology </h3>
      <p>
        Risk Aversion and The Role of Human Psychology in Risk Everyone dislikes
        uncertainty and risk. When risk becomes imminent, the stock market often
        reflects this sentiment by declining sharply. This reaction stems from
        fear and uncertainty about the futureâ€”when the path ahead becomes
        unclear, investors are gripped by doubt. A notable example is the onset
        of COVID-19, which triggered widespread panic and a dramatic sell-off in
        global markets.
