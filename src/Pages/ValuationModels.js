      <h1>Introduction to Valuation Models</h1>
      <p>
        Valuation models are tools and frameworks used to determine the value of
        an asset, typically a company or its stock. These models are essential
        in the world of investing as they help investors make informed decisions
        about whether an asset is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced in
        the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of valuation models is to provide a systematic
        approach to estimate an asset’s intrinsic value. By comparing this
        intrinsic value with the current market price, investors can identify
        potential opportunities or risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced investor, mastering
        valuation models is a fundamental step in understanding the financial
        landscape and making smarter investment choices.
