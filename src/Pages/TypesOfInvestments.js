      <h1>Types of Investments</h1>

      <h2>Stocks (Equities)</h2>
      <p>
        Stocks represent ownership in a company. They have the potential for
        high returns but come with higher risks. For example, purchasing shares
        of Apple or Tesla allows you to participate in the company's growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Bonds</h2>
      <p>
        Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. They
        provide fixed interest payments and are generally lower-risk. Examples
        include U.S. Treasury Bonds or corporate bonds.
      </p>

      <h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrencies are digital assets based on blockchain technology. They
        are high-risk, high-reward, and highly volatile. Examples include
        Bitcoin and Ethereum.
      </p>

      <h2>Real Estate</h2>
      <p>
        Investing in property can provide rental income or capital appreciation.
        While it requires significant capital, it offers steady income. Examples
        include purchasing rental properties or investing in REITs.
      </p>

      <h2>Mutual Funds/ETFs</h2>
      <p>
        These are pooled investment vehicles that hold a diversified portfolio.
        They are great for beginners due to built-in diversification. An example
        is the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).
      </p>

      <h2>Commodities</h2>
      <p>
        Commodities are physical assets like gold, oil, or agricultural
        products. They are often used as a hedge against inflation. For example,
        investing in gold or crude oil futures can protect against economic
        uncertainty.
      </p>

      <h2>Alternative Investments</h2>
      <p>
        Alternative investments include hedge funds, private equity, and
        collectibles. These are generally for sophisticated investors with high
        risk tolerance. Examples include investing in fine art or venture
        capital funds.
