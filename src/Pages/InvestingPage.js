      <h1>What is investment</h1>
      <p>
        Investing, at its core, is about making informed and rational decisions
        based on available information and differing perspectives. It involves
        careful analysis, weighing viewpoints, and executing strategies to
        achieve specific financial goals. But investing is not limited to stocks
        or financial assets—it’s a principle embedded in everyday life.

        Imagine you’re nearing graduation, and a group of friends invites you to
        go out the night before a major exam. You know your exam is critical to
        your future. What do you do? Do you choose a night out or stay home to
        study?
      </p>
      <p>
        Any action that involves collecting information, analyzing it, and
        making a choice to maximize resources is an investment. Like learning a
        new skill, pursuing higher education, or deciding your future career.
        Each of these moments requires investment—of time, energy, or emotions.

        Another term closely related to investing is speculation. Speculation is
        often misunderstood as being separate from or even the opposite of
        traditional investing. In truth, speculation is also a type of
        investment. Both investing and speculation share the same foundation:
        allocating resources today with the hope of achieving future returns,
        while navigating uncertainty. The difference lies in
        strategy—speculation often focuses on shorter-term opportunities and
        requires a higher tolerance for risk.

        <h2>First Lesson: Don’t Lose All Your Money</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re speculating on market trends or investing in value
        stocks, the golden rule remains the same: preserve your capital. Without
        safeguarding your resources, you lose the ability to participate in
        future opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my experience working in the securities industry, I’ve seen many
        clients buy stocks and leave them unattended for years, clinging to the
        hope of a turnaround. Often, these companies gradually decline toward
        bankruptcy, leaving the investors with nothing. We call it Sunk Cost
        decision.

        Money is money—even if a stock falls from $10 to $1, you still have $1
        left. That $1 is your chance to rebuild. Once you lose everything, your
        ability to recover disappears.To survive, you need discipline, a clear
        mind, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Above all,
        never lose sight of the importance of preserving your capital—it’s the
        foundation of everything.
      </p>

        The market doesn’t offer miracles—it ruthlessly reveals human nature,
        exposing greed, fear, and the consequences of inaction.
